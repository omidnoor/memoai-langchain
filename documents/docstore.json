[["0",{"pageContent":"all right so here's the story I wastrying to figure out how to fill theinside of a object and blender usinggeometry nodes and fill it with pointsso I can do some cool stuff with so Ifound a video by antagma andsafe to say I gave up before I startedit was so complicated shout out tointact but to my surprise I continued toresearch and I found a node that wasrecently added to blender that no one'stalking about and I absolutely lovebecause you can do so many cool thingswith it so I'm going to show you whatthe note is show you what you can dowith it and we'll get into that rightafter this quick shout out welcome toreal-time materials a collection ofcustomizable procedural materialscompatible with Eevee and Cycles thisadd-on will speed up your workflowallowing you to stay creative whilemaximizing your artistic outputreal-time materials are loaded withcustom properties giving you the freedomto change roughness color and all kindsof patterns you can change the shape ofwood the direction of cloth weave andthe size of scratches among many otherparameters even if you already know howto make procedural materials imagine thetime you will save if you could applythose materials in one easy clickall right so we're in blender 3.6 and uhthat's what I'm not exactly sure wherethey implemented it but it's always goodto have the latest version anyway thisis the character I'm using and you canuse anything from a logo A Primitiveobject whatever you want so here's howit's going to work in Geometry notes goahead and create a new geometry geometrynodes tree can't speak todayum up here in this uh shortcut here whatI'm going to do we're going to get themesh to volume and here we go this iswhat we're working with now you can seehow it's very puffy and far bigger thanuh you know originally so what we'regoing to do is bring this exteriorbandwidth all the way down to zero andthat's going to show you what you hadoriginally distribute points in volumethis is the node that I'm so excitedabout we'll throw it in there and nowyou can see some points you can go aheadand bring up that density it'll start toform the original mesh so what I'm goingto do is get a instance on points andI'm going to use I'm going to use theicosphere as our object and you bringthat radius down and what you have to donow is bring up that density and I canbring it on this one as well it's muchmore hyperactive on this side and thisiswhat we're doing here all right so Iwent ahead and threw a noise texture anda color ramp onto the scale of theinstance on point so that you can reallysee a very quick demonstration of howcool this is but this isn't the only onecheck it out so we have random you'reseeing a random setup hereum but what you can do is switch it overto grid and then I'm going to go aheadhighlight and do 0.02 to show you herewe go it's almost like re-meshing it ina really weird way we'll do0.03 a little bit lighter on the remeshand we can just bring this color in sothis is also another very interestingwayto fill the grid and here's what's funnow we're here but this is the videosdone we you can now go home and playwith this video's over but let me showyou can do some really interestingthings with it so as you can see I threwa noise texture and a color ramp on thescale and if you play with the w you canthen have a lot of fun with this righthere but let me show you how I createdthis animation uh just very quickly soany kind of geometry under your sceneand we're going to go ahead and get inthe volume Cube distribute points involume of course and change this fromrandom to grid so now we have a nicegrid going on which is super coolinstance on points and let's go aheadand create a cube I'm going to go aheadand create a bevel for it and then kindof bring the bevel pretty wide now dragthe cube in here as your object and pluggeometry into instance we're going to domy scale down like this so we can kindof see everything we're going to do myspacing at point one so now we havecreated this we're going to need a wavetexture to create this effect and we'llplug color into the color ramp and thecolor ramp into the instance on pointsscale socket then if you use the whiteportion of the color amp that's going todictate your size the black and thewhite we're going to go from bands torings and then X to spherical and thenwe're going to do 0.1 and now if webring in our color rampsomething like this you can actuallywatch the phase create the effect we'retrying to make and then you can go justgo ahead and fine tune this effect soI'm going to bring my uh spacing here to0.2 on everything we're going to geteverything to almost touch here and thenyou can play with this phase offsetso we can bring in this color ramp tokind of do our magic like that againphase offset creates the effect and thenall we have to do is Loop the animationso we'll just go ahead get a timelineand looping the wave texture is theeasiest thing on earth we're going tokeep it at 250 frames go back to frameone I mean frame zero hit I go to theend and then type in let's do fourasterisk Pi enterkeyframe and now we have animated thisreally cool effect that brings in injustlike that and that's it that's the noteI wanted to talk about it's cool add alot of extra things that you didn'treally need to know but the more themerrier I hope you have some fun withthis but that's it thank you guys forwatching feel free to check outreal-time materials that help supportthe channel and help me have time tofind really cool things like this andI'll see you guys in the next tutorial"}]]
